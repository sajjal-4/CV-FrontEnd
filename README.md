## Files Included

*   `cv.html`: The main HTML file containing the resume structure and content.
*   `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the resume's appearance.
*   `logo.png`: An image file used as the profile picture.
*   `fontawesome`: A library for displaying beautiful icons

## How to View the Resume

1.  **Clone or Download:** Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2.  **Navigate:** Open the `cv.html` file in your file explorer.
3.  **Open in Browser:** Right-click on the `cv.html` file and select "Open with" followed by your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

## Customization

You can easily customize this resume to reflect your own information:

*   **Content:** Edit the text within the `cv.html` file to update your contact details, summary, work experience, education, skills, and references.
*   **Styling:** Modify the `styles.css` file to change the resume's colors, fonts, layout, and other visual aspects.  You'll need some basic CSS knowledge to do this effectively.
*   **Profile Image:** Replace the `logo.png` file with your own profile picture.  Make sure the new image is named `logo.png` and has similar dimensions for the best results.

**Important Considerations for Customization:**

*   **HTML Structure:** Be careful when modifying the HTML structure (the tags and elements) as it can break the layout.
*   **CSS Selectors:** Understand how CSS selectors work to target the correct elements for styling.  Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML and CSS and see how the styles are applied.
*   **Responsiveness:** The current CSS may not be fully responsive (meaning it might not look good on all screen sizes). You may need to adjust the CSS to make it more responsive if you plan to view the resume on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   Font Awesome (for icons)
